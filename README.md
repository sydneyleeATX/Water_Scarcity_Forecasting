My project aimed to forecast water scarcity for Lake Travis in Austin, TX using XGBoost. The ultimate goal was to support proactive resource management and policy planning. The target variable was lake water levels. Data was aggregated and cleaned from multiple sources for dates ranging from 1950 - present day. Future data points for necessary features were generated using averaging (in the case of weather) and expert projections (in the case of population data). Lag features for water_level were generated. As the model predicted the next value for water_level, the target variable, forward fill was used to fill in missing entries in the lag feature columns. The mean absolute error was 9.55 and the relative MAE was 1.46%. The model was able to successfully emulate the trends in the actual data for an unseen test set.
